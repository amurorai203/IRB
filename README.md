# About the Projects

This project aims to create a user-friendly application that empowers individuals to manage their personal recipe collection. The app will leverage user-provided inputs and suggestions to curate a personalized library of recipes, showcasing our expertise in working with APIs.

We're passionate about food, but let's be honest - planning meals can feel overwhelming. That's why we created a tool to help you discover exciting new recipes, organise them easily, and save them. (or when you're faced with that familiar "What's for dinner?" question).
